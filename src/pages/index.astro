				Notes on content architecture, system design, and the places where human judgment still matters in
				AI-assisted workflows.
			</p>

			<p>
				This site explores how content is structured, governed, and evolved in technical systems, and why
				keeping humans meaningfully in the loop is an architectural decision, not a UX afterthought.
			</p>

				what breaks when human judgment is abstracted away.
